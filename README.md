# stupid-bot-discord
This is my first Discord bot and it's fairly stupid. 😁
As of now, it is nothing more than programming practice...

Main features:
- *Self-Generating* help menu
- fun commands, such as `howfat`
- not-to-poorly-written code
- lots of stupidity, as the bot's name suggests

You are free to do whatever you please with the **Stupid Bot**!
📚 Use is as a template to build other bots;
🎆 Modify it to oblivion;
💥 Make it crash;
🚪 Find vulnerabilities within its few lines of code;
🤖 Beep Boop it!
```
- Language: C#
- API: Discord.Net
- IDE: VS Code + .NET Framework
```
